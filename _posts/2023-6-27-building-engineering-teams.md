title: Building Engineering Teams
---

Engineering teams play a crucial role in the success of product-focussed organisations: given the opportunity, they can innovate, develop, and deliver products that meet customer needs and drive business growth. Building and maintaining effective teams isn't a simple task and isn't something that happens overnight. Here I'll share some thoughts I've collected over the years on how you can build effective engineering teams. 

## Define Clear Goals & Expectations
The foundation of a successful engineering team starts with clearly defined goals and expectations. Here's where we break out the good old "specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound" (SMART) goals framework - it works! It allows team members to understand their roles and responsibilities and fosters a sense of ownership and accountability. Regularly revisiting and updating these goals keeps the team focused but also adaptable to changing circumstances.

## Hire for Complementary Skills
An effective engineering team has, ideally, individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. Embrace diversity in both technical and non-technical aspects, as this can lead to fresh perspectives, creative problem-solving, and innovation. Look for _#humans_ who not only possess technical prowess but also demonstrate strong communication & teamwork skills. 

## Foster Open Communication
Open communication and a culture of collaboration are essential ingredients for a successful engineering team. Create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback. Regular team meetings, stand-ups, and brainstorming sessions can facilitate open discussions and foster a sense of camaraderie. Emphasize the value of constructive criticism, ensuring that feedback is given and received respectfully to promote continuous improvement. This is probably the hardest thing for engineering teams to do well, especially if teams are used to feedback being negative. 

## Learning Is Key
Tech and engineering practices / tooling evolve rapidly, so we should make _continuous learning_ a fundamental requirement of our engineering teams. Encourage team members to participate in workshops, attend conferences, hackathons. Maybe even invest in your team so they can do these things on work time? If you can, provide access to training resources. Above all, encourage knowledge sharing within the team.

## Empower Autonomy & Decision-Making
Empower team members to take ownership of their work and provide them with the autonomy to make decisions. When team members feel trusted and supported, they are more likely to take (considered) risks, and explore innovative solutions. The key here is _trust_.
