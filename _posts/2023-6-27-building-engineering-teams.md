title: Building Engineering Teams
---

Engineering teams play a crucial role in the success of any organization: they can innovate, develop, and deliver products that meet customer needs and drive business growth. Building and maintaining effective teams isn't a simple task: it requires thoughtful planning, a clear vision, and a commitment to creating a collaborative and inclusive environment. 

## Define Clear Goals & Expectations
The foundation of a successful engineering team starts with clearly defined goals and expectations. Here's where we break the the good old "specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound" (SMART) goals framework - it works! It allows team members to understand their roles and responsibilities and fosters a sense of ownership and accountability. Regularly revisiting and updating these goals keeps the team focused but also adaptable to changing circumstances.

## Hire for Complementary Skills
An effective engineering team comprises individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. Embrace diversity in both technical and non-technical aspects, as this can lead to fresh perspectives, creative problem-solving, and enhanced innovation. Look for _#humans_ who not only possess technical prowess but also demonstrate strong communication, teamwork, and leadership skills.

## Open Communication and Collaboration
Open communication and a culture of collaboration are essential ingredients for a successful engineering team. Create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback. Regular team meetings, stand-ups, and brainstorming sessions can facilitate open discussions and foster a sense of camaraderie. Emphasize the value of constructive criticism, ensuring that feedback is given and received respectfully to promote continuous improvement.

## Learning Is Key
Tech and engineering practices / tooling evolve rapidly, so we should make continuous learning a fundamental requirement of our engineering teams. Encourage team members to participate in workshops, attend conferences, and engage in professional development opportunities. Provide access to training resources and encourage knowledge sharing within the team.

## Empower Autonomy & Decision-Making
Empower team members to take ownership of their work and provide them with the autonomy to make decisions. When team members feel trusted and supported, they are more likely to take (considered) risks, and explore innovative solutions.
