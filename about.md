## Hey, I'm Chris 👋

I've been writing code, building systems and running highly effective engineering teams for over 12 years. I'm great in roles that need lots of communication and working in cross-functional teams. 

### Core skills 
- 🎯 tech leadership (CTO / DoE / Tech Dir / Tech Lead / Principal Eng.)
- ⚒️ architecting scalable platforms (on AWS, GC & the rest)
- 👏 mentoring & building teams 
- 💻 ...and writing code too (Node, JS, Python, Ruby, Rust)

### Recent experience
- At [Cogsy](https://cogsy.com/), I helped lead the team in leveraging machine learning to power intelligent inventory forecasting & growth planning for DTC businesses, integrating with Shopify & Amazon FBA.

- As CTO of [Landmrk](https://landmrk.it/), I led the development of a marketing platform working with global brands such as Universal & Warner Bros built on highly-available auto-scaling AWS architecture, managing several dev teams across the core platform and campaign-specific projects.
