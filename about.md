## Hey, I'm Chris 👋

I'm Director of Software Engineering for The Bump, part of The Knot Worldwide.

I've been writing code, building systems and running highly effective engineering teams for over 13 years. I'm great in roles that need lots of communication and working in cross-functional teams. 

I'm writing this blog as a way to bring together the experiences I've had during my career around engineering, leading teams and all things software development for startups, agencies, product platforms and enterprises.

### Core skills 
- 🎯 tech leadership (CTO / DoE / Tech Dir / Tech Lead / Principal Eng.)
- ⚒️ architecting scalable platforms (on AWS, GC & the rest)
- 👏 mentoring & building teams 
- 💻 ...and writing code too (Node, JS, Python, Ruby, Rust)

### Other experience
- At [Cogsy](https://cogsy.com/), I helped lead the team in leveraging machine learning to power intelligent inventory forecasting & growth planning for DTC businesses, integrating with Shopify & Amazon FBA.

- As CTO of [Landmrk](https://landmrk.it/), I led the development of a marketing platform working with global brands such as Universal & Warner Bros built on highly-available auto-scaling AWS architecture, managing several dev teams across the core platform and campaign-specific projects.
  
- As the Technical Director of Create Health, I worked with the WHO to deliver the AAHA Project
